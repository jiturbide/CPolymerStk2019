# Using a Computed Property

Shows data binding to a property that is computed based on other property
values.

Define computed properties in the `computed` object on the elementâ€™s prototype:

    Polymer({
      firstName: 'Rob',
      lastName: 'Dodson',
      computed: {
        fullName: "firstName + ' ' + lastName"
      }
    });

A computed property consists of a property name and a Polymer expression.
When any value in the expression changes, the computed property updates.

In this example, `fullName` is a computed property that updates whenever
`firstName` or `lastName` change.

Read the
[official documentation for computed properties](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#computed-properties).

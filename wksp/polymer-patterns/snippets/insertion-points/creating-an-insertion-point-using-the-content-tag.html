# Creating an Insertion Point using the Content Tag

Shows how to implement element composition by creating an **insertion point**.

Use the `<content>` tag to declare an insertion point:

    <template>
      <p>Shadow DOM</p>
      <content></content>
      <p>Shadow DOM again</p>
    </template>

The insertion point selects and presents content from the shadow host. Nodes
inserted using `<content>` are called **distributed nodes**.

Consider this use of the element in this snippet:

    <my-element><i>Distributed node</i></my-element>

This creates the following composed tree:

    <p>Shadow DOM</p>
    <i>Distributed node</i>
    <p>Shadow DOM again</p>

Note that the distributed nodes are correctly placed within the Shadow DOM
nodes.

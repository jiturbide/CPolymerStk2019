# Binding to a Property

Shows simple use of **data binding** in a Polymer element.

For Polymer elements, the model is the element itself, and any
element property is available in the template within **double mustaches**
(`{{}}`).

See
[binding-to-a-text-input.html](../forms/binding-to-a-text-input.html)
for a version of this snippet where the `color` property can be modified
using a text `<input>`, resulting in **two-way data binding**.

    Polymer({
      color: 'red'
    });

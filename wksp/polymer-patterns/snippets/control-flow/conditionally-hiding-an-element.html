# Conditionally Hiding an Element

Shows use **conditional boolean attributes** using **?=** syntax.

You can set an element's `hidden` property using `hidden?=`:

    <p hidden?="{{shortView}}">
      ...
    </p>

The boolean attribute gets set if it is bound to a `true` value. Note the
use of `?=` syntax for conditionally setting a boolean attribute.

Read the
[official documentation for conditional attributes]
(http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/binding-types.html#conditional-attributes).

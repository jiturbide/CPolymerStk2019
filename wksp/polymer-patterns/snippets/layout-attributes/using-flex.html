# Using Flex Attributes

Shows use of `flex` attribute to expand a child node.

The `flex` attribute causes the child to expand and fill as much of its
parent container as possible.

    <section layout horizontal>
      <div>Foo</div>
      <div flex>Bar</div>
      <div>Baz</div>
    </section>

In this example, the second child will expand to take up most of the parent,
pushing the third child to the edge of the screen.

Read the
[official documentation for flex attributes](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html#flexible-children).

# Creating a One Time Binding

Shows simple use of **one-time data binding** in a Polymer element.

**Note: This feature is experimental**

Use **double square brackets** (`[[ ]]`) instead of double mustaches (`{{ }}`)
to set up a one-time binding. The binding becomes inactive after Polymer sets
the inital value for the bound property.

A one-time binding can potentially boost performance because you avoid the
overhead of setting up property observation.

Read the
[official documentation for one-time bindings](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/binding-types.html#one-time-bindings).

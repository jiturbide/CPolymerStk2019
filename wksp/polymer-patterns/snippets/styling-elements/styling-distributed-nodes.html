# Styling distributed nodes

Shows the use of the `::content` pseudo element to style distributed nodes.

The `<content>` tag allows you to select and insert nodes into
predefined locations in your element. These locations are called insertion
points and the inserted nodes are called distributed nodes.
See [insertion point snippets](../insertion-points/) to learn more about the
`<content>` tag and distributed nodes.

The CSS `::content` pseudo-element is a way to style nodes that pass through an
insertion point:

    ::content p {
      color: red;
    }

    ::content .blue {
      color: blue;
    }

In this snippet, distributed `<p>` elements are red, and distributed `<p>`
elements _with the class "blue" are blue. You can use `<my-element>`
like this:

    <my-element>
      <p class="blue">Blue distributed node</p>
      <p>Red distributed node</p>
    </my-element>

Doing so generates this composed tree:

      <p class="blue">Blue distributed node</p>
      <p>Inside my-element</p>
      <p>Red distributed node</p>

Note that since styles defined using `::content` apply only to distributed
nodes, the `<p>` sandwiched between the `<content>` tags in `<my-element>` is
not affected by them.

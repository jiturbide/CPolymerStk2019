# Using `:host-context` to theme an element

Shows how to use the `:host-context` pseudo class with a selector that is matched
against an ancestor element.  This is a convenient way to 'theme' a Polymer
element.

The snippet defines an element with the following styles:

    :host-context(.red) {
      color: red;
    }
    :host-context(.blue) {
      color: blue;
    }

Styles defined in the `:host-context(.red)` block apply only if `<my-element>`
has an ancestor with the class 'red', and the styles in the
`:host-context(.blue)` apply only if `<my-element>` has an ancestor with the
class 'blue'.

Consider the following use of `<my-element>`:

    <div>
      <my-element></my-element>
    </div>

    <div class="red">
      <my-element></my-element>
    </div>

    <div class="blue">
      <div>
        <my-element></my-element>
      </div>
    </div>

Inside `<div class="red">`, `<my-element>`'s text is red, and inside
`<div class="blue">`, it is blue. Inside the first `<div>`, the styles defined
using `:host-context` do not apply.

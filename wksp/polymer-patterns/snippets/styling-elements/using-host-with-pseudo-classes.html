# Using `:host` with CSS pseudo classes

Shows how to use `:host` with pseudo classes to react to different user-driven
states.

In the definition of `<my-element>` below, `:host` is used with the
`:hover` pseudo class.

    :host(:hover) {
      opacity: 0.5;
    }

When a user hovers over `<my-element>`, its opacity changes.

# Using `:host` with a CSS selector

Shows how to use `:host(<selector>)` to apply styles to instances of an element
that match a selector.

The snippet defines the following styles:

    :host {
      color: green;
    }
    :host(.red) {
      color: red;
    }
    :host(.blue) {
      color: blue;
    }

The first `:host` block defines styles that apply to all `<my-element>`s. The
`:host(.red)` block defines styles for `<my-element>`s with the class 'red',
and the `:host(.blue)` block defines styles my `<my-element>`s with the class
`blue`.

Assume that `<my-element>` is used like this:

    <my-element></my-element>
    <my-element class="red"></my-element>
    <my-element class="blue"></my-element>

The first `<my-element>` is green (the default color), the second `<my-element>`
is red, and the last `<my-element>` is blue.
